# Automated Machine Learning Script Generation Using LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct

## Overview

This project leverages the LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct model to automate the generation of Python scripts for comprehensive machine learning tasks. The script covers detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), meticulous data preprocessing, thorough feature selection, comprehensive model selection, rigorous model training and evaluation, and in-depth model comparison and selection. The generated script is structured, modular, and easy to follow, with detailed explanations, visualizations, additional guidelines for error handling, and reproducibility.

## Features

- **Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate EDA code with visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features using various techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance from models, and recursive feature elimination.
- **Model Selection and Training**: Compare multiple machine learning models, train them, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Model Evaluation and Comparison**: Compare models based on performance metrics and select the best model.
- **Documentation and Reproducibility**: Generate detailed documentation and Jupyter Notebooks to ensure the process is reproducible and well-documented.

## Tools and Libraries

- **LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct**: For generating and executing data analysis, visualization, and modeling code.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for script generation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ankit-KK/GenAi-For-Building-Machine_Learning_Models.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script to generate a new machine learning project:
    ```bash
    python MLAutoGen.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to input your dataset and select options for EDA, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the script:

1. Provide a dataset file (CSV format).
2. The script will generate a Python script with the following structure:
    - **EDA**: Generate summary statistics and visualizations.
    - **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data.
    - **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features.
    - **Modeling**: Train and evaluate multiple models.
    - **Evaluation**: Compare models and select the best one.
